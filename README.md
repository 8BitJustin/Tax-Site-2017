# Tax-Site-2017
Updated version of the AZ Tax and Business website

This was created as an update to the original AZ Tax and Business website. When that was originally created, I didn't focus on the mobile aspect. Unfortunately, with that, there were a large amount of issues when viewed at a lower resolution.

This site, takes a mobile first approach. Though not perfect, it's definitely viewable at lower resoltuions. Complete with .php form, this site is ready to go live once the 'personal' information is provided.
